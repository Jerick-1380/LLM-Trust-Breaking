"""
Analyze announcement compliance - the key metric for out-group trust.

In Diners:
- Agent announces "CHEAP"
- Does the other agent choose CHEAP (compliance) or EXPENSIVE (defection)?

This is the metric that revealed the out-group trust phenomenon:
- Llama minority announces → GPT ignores (low compliance)
- GPT minority announces → Llama believes (high compliance)
